### Integration without Submodules
To maintain compatability with other projects, please put everything into ```/Assets/iffnsStuff/iffnsLocalMovementSystemForVRChat``` 

### Git Submodule integration
Add this submodule with the following git command (Assuming the root of your Git project is the Unity project folder)
```
git submodule add https://github.com/iffn/iffnsLocalMovementSystemForVRChat.git Assets/iffnsStuff/iffnsLocalMovementSystemForVRChat

If you have manually added it, use this one first. (I recommend to close the Unity project first)
